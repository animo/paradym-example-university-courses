      "content": "# React 101\n\n## Introduction\n\nReact is a powerful JavaScript library used for building interactive user interfaces. It has gained immense popularity in the web development community for its simplicity and reusability.\n\n## Components\n\nReact follows a component-based architecture, allowing developers to build reusable pieces of UI. There are two types of components in React:\n\n- Function Components: These are simple JavaScript functions that return JSX elements. They are the simplest and most commonly used components in React.\n\n- Class Components: These are JavaScript classes that extend the React.Component class and have a render method. They provide additional features like state and lifecycle methods but come with more boilerplate code compared to function components.\n\n## State Management\n\nState management is an essential aspect of modern web development. React provides two main hooks for managing state:\n\n- `useState`: This hook enables functional components to have their own state. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that state.\n\n- `useReducer`: This hook is useful for managing complex state logic. It is similar to `useState`, but instead of a single value, it returns a state value and a dispatch function to update the state based on different actions.\n\n## Effects\n\nReact's `useEffect` hook allows developers to manage effects in functional components. Effects are used for performing side-effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.\n\n## Context API\n\nThe Context API in React provides a way to share data between components without having to pass it explicitly through props. It consists of two hooks:\n\n- `createContext`: This function creates a context object that can be shared among components.\n\n- `useContext`: This hook enables functional components to consume the context value.\n\n## Advanced Concepts\n\nReact offers several advanced concepts that extend the capabilities of components and provide advanced functionality in React applications:\n\n- Hooks: Hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components without writing a class.\n\n- Higher Order Components: Higher Order Components (HOCs) are functions that take a component and return an enhanced version of that component. HOCs are used for code reuse, cross-cutting concerns, and abstraction.\n\n## Testing\n\nTesting is an integral part of building robust and reliable applications. React provides two main tools for testing:\n\n- Jest: A powerful JavaScript testing framework that provides a simple and flexible way to write tests for React components and utilities.\n\n- React Testing Library: A testing library built on top of React and Jest that facilitates writing tests that resemble how a user would interact with the application.\n\nGet started with React and unlock the potential of building interactive and dynamic user interfaces!\n"
